# Assassins game

This is an in-person game for 3 or more players. The objective is to make your target say a specific word. This kills them and assigns their previous target to you. Survive to the end or score the most points for victory!

## Setup

Run `server.py` on a computer. Then all players can connect to the game server and enter their name. Browsing to the site from the server will instead serve an admin panel where you can manage the list of current players.

It is essential that the server and all the players are on the same network.

## Rules in detail

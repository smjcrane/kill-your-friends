<p>Welcome to Kill Your Friends, the friendly assassin game!</p>
<p>You will be assigned a target, and it is your task to kill that person.</p>
<p>You will achieve this with the deadliest of weapons: words</p>
<p>When the game begins, you will be given a unique secret weapon. If your target says this word, they are dead! You must tell them this so that they can record it on their device.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p><i>Simon is trying to kill Chris by getting him to say the word "pasta"</i></p>
<p><i>SIMON: Hey Chris, I was thinking, what is your favourite food?</i></p>
<p><i>CHRIS: I would say my favourite food is probably pasta</i></p>
<p><i>SIMON: You're DEAD! The word was "pasta."</i></p>
<p><i>CHRIS: Oh no! I'll have to push the button now to let the game know</i></p>
<p>Please don't reveal your word to other players, or contract other players to do your killing for you</p>
<p>If your victim says their word by random chance, you MAY declare them dead, but we have tried to pick words where this won't happen</p>
<p>Try to convince your victim to say the word without saying it yourself.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<p><i>Simon is trying to kill Chris by getting him to say the word "pasta"</i></p>
<p><i>SIMON: Hey Chris, what is your favourite kind of pasta?</i></p>
<p><i>CHRIS: I would say my favourite pasta is probably spaghetti</i></p>
<p><i>SIMON: You're DEAD! The word was "pasta."</i></p>
<p><i>CHRIS: No, that doesn't count! And now I know the word I'm INVINCIBLE</i></p>
<p><i>SIMON: Oh no! :(</i></p>
<p>If this happens, you can ask to be assigned a new word but it will cost you a point.</p>
